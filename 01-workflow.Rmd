![The workflow of modeling with SHUD Modeling System](./Fig/autoSHUD.png)

1. Prepare raw Essential Terrestrial Variables (ETV)
2. Convert and crop raw data with the research area boundary.
1. Build the unstructued modeling domain with [SHUD-tools](https://github.com/SHUD-System/SHUD-tools) 
1. Run SHUD on desktop or cluster.
1. Analysis the SHUD model results with [SHUD-tools](https://github.com/SHUD-System/SHUD-tools) or your hydrologic analysis tools.
